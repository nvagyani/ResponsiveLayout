 
# Responsive Layout

1. cut HTML from Jpeg design and implement as a theme and put the page in a template of WordPress and make it editable via CMS
2. make home banner as a vertical carousel and slides can be switched by mouse scroll down. 
3. for box grids below the hero banner (2nd,4th and 6th row), create an animation to bring boxes in slowly from outer edge to centre (see our website work page for reference)
4. add hover states for nav and other CTA buttons (see our website for reference)
5. responsive for mobile
6. hover interaction for social icons at the bottom
7. Send us Github or any online code repository so we can review the code

7. Don't worry about doing the music section on the 2nd last panel in the jpeg design.
