 
# Responsive Layout

1. WordPress Theme 
   # Used AngularJS ng-include to include the templates in main HTML. Created templates with the Script template tags to work it locally.      But we can directly give relative path (./app/templates/nav.html) in URL when we have web server configration in place.
   
2. Responsive layout and carousel 
   # Used Bootstrap to create responsive layout and carousel
   
3. Animation
   # Created Scroll Animations with Waypoints and Animate.css
